# Coding competition: “Build your UEFA Euro 2020 dream team!”

Welcome to our new summer challenge: the Summer Coding Challenge.

As you probably know, there is a fantastic football competition going on right now. UEFA Euro 2020 is the European Football Championship where 24 men's national teams are competing for the title of champion.

In this context, we decided to focus the theme of this challenge on Euro 2020. The principle is simple: build a prototype of an application that allows you to select the team of your dreams based on the list of participants in the tournament.

Success in soccer is based on the strength of the team, which is also true when it comes to programming, so you will work on this challenge in teams of 3/4 people.

Just like soccer players, you will have 90 minutes to show your skills and succeed as a team! How will you do it? Let's find out together!

## INSTRUCTIONS

At the end of this challenge, we expect each team to develop a **functional full stack application**, with a front-end and a back-end communicating with each other. Also, for ease of use, the entire project will be developed **in Javascript technologies**.

To help you get started, we've provided a JSON file with all the player data. It is not mandatory to use this file, but keep in mind that you only have **90 minutes to complete this exercise**.

We have already identified the list of features that will have to be present in the application, and we also offer you to choose - if you wish - a bonus feature to implement from the given list.
Of course, we look forward to seeing you put your creativity to work in order to stand out from the other teams ... however, be careful with the timing ;)

To make it easier for us, please manage your solution (front-end & back-end) in a single Git repository. This way, we will have only one link per team.
Also, due to the imposed timing, the hosting of your solution is not required.

## FEATURES

### MAIN FEATURES

- View the list of all players in the competition.
- View the details of a player.
- Sort the list of players in ascending or descending order according to the criteria(s) you define.
- Filter the list of players with different filters (at least : name, country, position).
- Add a player to my team.
- Remove a player from my team.
- View the composition of my team.
- Define the formation of my team (4-4-2, 4-3-3, etc.).

### BONUS (choose one)

- Point system : each player costs a certain number of points, and each composition has a maximum number of points.
- Select a captain for my team, as well as the 5 substitutes. Each team will have 16 players.
- Name a Head Coach for your team (name, country).
- Add a picture for each player.

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

- Good practices & Code Quality

Code quality is an important point not to be neglected when it comes to building a solid foundation for an application. It is therefore naturally a point on which we will be particularly attentive when evaluating your solutions.
Little advice: KISS, DRY, SOLID principles ... if you know what we mean.

- Documentation (readme file)

We expect to find in your project a readme file explaining at least how to run the different parts of your project. For the rest, you can be creative ;)

- Architecture

There is no one way to do this exercise, of course. However, the choice of your architecture will be an important point in our review.

- Way of working (teamwork, git usage, etc.)

As a developer, you need to use the tools around you to your advantage in order to collaborate effectively with your team.
Git is a good example; make good use of it in this exercise.

- Originality of the solution

## HOW TO COLLABORATE

Since this edition is remote, there are several options for you to collaborate all together. Here are some tips:

Divide the team into several groups, each with a responsibility.
Work in peer-programming by sharing your screen.
Use existing tools like [Visual Studio LiveShare](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/).

# GOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN ! :rocket:
